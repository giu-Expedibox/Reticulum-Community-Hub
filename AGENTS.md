# AGENTS.md - RCH Rust Edition

This branch is the Rust transition branch for Reticulum Community Hub. The
Python implementation is preserved on `rch-python`; do not reintroduce Python,
Vue, or Electron source into `rust-next` unless the user explicitly asks for a
compatibility artifact.

## Project Shape

- Workspace root: `Cargo.toml`
- Main server crate: `crates/r3akt-rch-server`
- RCH domain/state crate: `crates/r3akt-rch-core`
- LXMF/Reticulum adapter crate: `crates/r3akt-transport-rns`
- TAK service boundary: `crates/r3akt-tak-connector`
- Rust edition: 2024
- Minimum Rust version: 1.85
- License: EPL-2.0

This workspace currently depends on the LXMF Rust workspace as a sibling
checkout named `LXMF-rs`.

Expected local layout:

```text
src/
├── Reticulum-Community-Hub/   # this repository
└── LXMF-rs/                   # dependency for lxmf-wire
```

## UI and Packaging

- `ui/` is imported from the canonical `ui-shared` branch and must stay
  compatible with both Python RCH 2.9.x and Rust `r3akt-rch-server`.
- `apps/rch-desktop/` is the Tauri desktop shell for the Rust product line.
- `packaging/` contains server package templates and install helpers.
- Keep Electron only on `rch-python`; do not reintroduce Electron packaging on
  `rust-next`.
- Rust server packages are the deployment primitive. Tauri is a desktop shell
  for local operator workstations.

## Required Checks

Run these before declaring Rust transition work complete:

```powershell
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

For release-critical backend work, also run:

```powershell
cargo test -p r3akt-rch-server
cargo test -p r3akt-rch-core
cargo test -p r3akt-transport-rns
cargo test -p r3akt-tak-connector
```

For shared UI changes, also run:

```powershell
npm --prefix ui ci
npm --prefix ui run lint
npm --prefix ui run test
npm --prefix ui run build
```

For Rust package changes, run the relevant package build:

```powershell
cargo build --release -p r3akt-rch-server
npm --prefix apps/rch-desktop install
npm --prefix apps/rch-desktop run build
```

## Operational Workflows

- Use `.\scripts\release-readiness.ps1 -ServerOnlyAlpha` as the local
  server-only release gate. Use `-LiveTak -LiveReticulum` only after the
  required live infrastructure is configured and reachable.
- For local Reticulum receipt, fanout, and ZeroMQ event-poll validation, run
  `.\scripts\local-reticulum-live-gate.ps1 -IncludeZmqEventPoll` with the
  sibling `LXMF-rs\target\debug\reticulumd.exe` available. Add
  `-IncludeZmqLoad` or `-ZmqLoadOnly` for the local ZeroMQ load gate.
- Full Rust release packages are built by `.github/workflows/rust-release.yml`;
  manual runs upload workflow artifacts, and published GitHub releases receive
  server archives, checksums, and desktop bundles as release assets.
- For Python store migration into the Rust runtime, dry-run
  `scripts\import-python-rch-production.ps1 -SourceRoot . -LegacyStore RTH_Store -TargetDir target\production-rch-3 -DryRun`
  before running the same command without `-DryRun`.

## Compatibility Rules

- Preserve the RCH northbound contract as the compatibility target: `/Status`,
  `/Help`, `/Examples`, OpenAPI, REST route families, WebSocket streams, R3AKT
  mission/checklist APIs, file/image/topic/subscriber/client routes, and auth
  behavior.
- Keep Python parity gaps documented in `README.md` or `docs/rust-transition.md`.
- Keep runtime artifacts untracked: `target/`, SQLite DBs, logs, screenshots,
  `.playwright-mcp/`, and generated local files.
- Do not mutate `rch-python` from this branch. Python maintenance belongs on
  the `rch-python` branch.
